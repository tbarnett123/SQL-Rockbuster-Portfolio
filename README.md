# SQL-Rockbuster-Portfolio
## Project Summary
This repository presents a comprehensive SQL-based analysis of Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a global movie rental company transitioning into the digital streaming market to compete with platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime. Leveraging its existing film licenses, Rockbuster aims to develop a data-driven strategy for launching and sustaining its new online service.

The analysis explores key business questions posed by management for the 2020 strategy, including identifying which films generate the most and least revenue, understanding average rental durations, mapping customer locations and lifetime value, and evaluating regional sales trends. Using SQL, these insights were extracted directly from company data and visualized to guide strategic decision-making.

This project demonstrates advanced SQL querying, data interpretation, and visualization skills showcasing the ability to transform raw business data into actionable insights that inform real-world strategic and operational planning across industries.
